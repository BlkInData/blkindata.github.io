Pronouns: she/her 

I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student in Pathobiology and Translational Science (PBTS) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). My work uses integrative genomic approaches to study environmental and genetic determinants of cancer, leading to health disparities. My long-term research and professional goals are to study the environmental and genetic interplay in cancer health disparities in minority groups and to expand on this research in my own lab as an independent investigator in academia.

You can also find me on Twitter [@MarkiaASmith](https://twitter.com/MarkiaASmith), where I post about all things cancer, health disparities, data troubleshooting, and diversity + equity + inclusion efforts. 

Outside of science, I am a volunteer doula, mentor for underrepresented populations, huge foodie, traveler (been to 39 of the 50 states thus far), and avid lifter.
