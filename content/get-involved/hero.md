## Our partnerships

In Black In Data, we value the partnerships we've made with individuals and organisations. We acknowledge the time and efforts of our partners below in becoming allies of and supporting #BlackInDataWeek. 

#### BlackTIDES

Kimberly D provided update on BlackTIDES contribution to the week which includes (1) broadening the scope to ensure that the multitude of Black in Data avenues are represented, (2) mentorship avenues and (3) layering contribution to overall week
Kimberly D also mentioned an industry colleague who works for US Gov that would like to contribute to the week in the form of a blog or video Q and A etc. It was discussed that this would be valuable to place on our Black in data website. 
Kimberly D also mentioned that BlackTIDES are looking to provide quick Fireside Chats and are actively seeking broad representation on the panel from Data/Social Sciences, a reminder to share among networks! 
Kimberly D also recommended Tenekia’s ‘Dashboard in a day’ webinar to be included as part of the Data Viz Day. 

#### Data Visualisation Society

@yuliakrolik - Julia Krolik - dvspartnerships@gmail.com
They are happy to help with the Data Visualization Challenge.  Christine is happy to lead Data Visualization Challenge and liaise collaboration with Data Viz Society - could do with some help.
They have a data visualization journal called Nightingale and would love to publish an article either an interview or some other way to help amplify. We have an editor that will support and we can offer an honorarium for the writer and illustrator (if one is needed). coordinating article involves: (1) liaising with nightingale folk (2) arranging committee interviews (3) identifying (Black?) writer or illustrator for opportunity. 


#### Health Data Research UK

@MLewisBrown - Melissa Lewis Brown - Melissa.Lewis-Brown@hdruk.ac.uk 

Ruth, Victor, and Markia met with HDRUK to discuss the possibility of short term and long term goals for forming a strong collaboration. 
Their current goals: Black internship, Black leadership academy, potentially BAME network within their organization
Long term goals: Appoint Ruth to advisory board to be involved in diversity, equity, and inclusive initiatives with HDRUK

#### Real Scientists

@sciencebanshee - Sarah Faber - thisissciencetwitter@gmail.com 
We are doing twitter take-over of @realscientists from 15th-21st (a day before the week begins til the end)
We need to respond to their email and fill in the form with info on who will be taking over twitter page - we need to decide who (can be multiple people, so please volunteer) will take-over account. They also sent a style guide. Christine, Amanda, and Blossom, Crystal to takeover

I'm Sarah and I'm one of the moderators for Real Scientists (@RealScientists) on twitter. We're a rotating curator account
for scientists to talk about their work and lives and are so excited to have you host the account for Black In Data week!!!
Our timeslots are Sunday to the following Saturday (I'll send a calendar invite shortly), and while you're on the account,
you can tweet about whatever you like (we try to make it as low-stress an experience as possible). We don't have a tweet
quota or anything, tweet as much or as little as you like, RT the heck out of posts from the organizers/folks engaging with
the hashtags, etc. #BlackInChem just wrapped up, and their committee had one of the founders running the account for
the week talking about their work and amplifying #BlackandChem posts from other folks. #BlackAndNeuro did things a bit
differently and ran the account as a committee with their graphics in lieu of a profile picture. We've also done daily
rotations where a different person from the organization curates each day. Have a think about it and let me know what
you'd like to try.
Info-wise, we ask our curators to fill out our standard questionnaire (https://goo.gl/forms/52yCFg27Ck6Ku50C2), and
send us a brief bio and a couple of photos (the questionnaire responses get assembled into an introductory blog post). If
you're thinking about doing the takeover as a committee, we can definitely switch it up and make it less about "this is my
background and current work" to "here's us and what we do; and here's our initiative and what we're going to talk about
this week".

#### We Are R Ladies
From We are R ladies, promote #TidyTuesday and encourage them to use #BlackInDataWeek. Have people analyze data related to Black people

#TidyTuesday: Suggestion from Christine - RLadies, RStats, and r4ds community participate in weekly wrangling and viz-- participating and combining tags will increase our visibility. 
Preamble we need to confirm from off-set - everyone is on board that #BlackInDataViz could be general hashtag for people to share stories/random plots on the Thurs, and we use #BlackInDataVizComp specifically for people manipulating our TBD chosen dataset (both on our Thurs and two days prior to this on #TidyTues - maybe #TidyTues folks encouraged to use #BlackInDataWeek hashtag so that #BlackInDataVizComp preserved for Thurs)
Christine, Amanda, and Kailande are happy to lead Data Visualization Challenge and liaise with #TidyTues folks to submit our #BlackInDataVizComp dataset to them for promo within the wider R community on Tues before our Thurs. 

Markia will take over during BID week (Nov 16-20th)  and Damilola will be taking over the week following BID week (Nov 23-27).
