> I am Black in data because: coding provides me with both a science and an art.

Pronouns: she/her 

I specialise in the fields of single-cell RNA sequencing, immunology and haematopoiesis. I work in the lab of [Muzlifah Haniffa](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/mahaniffa.html) at Newcastle University and am fully-funded by the [Barbour Foundation](https://www.barbour.com/uk/the-barbour-foundation). My research contributes to the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) Development initiative where I investigate haematopoiesis in the human fetal bone marrow.

I enjoy coding within the broad field of Biology, and have a personal interest in immunology and autoimmunity through my experience living with rheumatoid arthritis. Past bioinformatic projects have explored antibiotic resistance treatment and gene homology database curation.

I care deeply about equity in access to higher education, and as such, have been involved in community building and voluntary scientific outreach work since the beginning of my academic journey. I have almost 10 years experience in the charity sector and am an acting trustee for the [National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society](https://www.nras.org.uk/trustees). 

I have roots in London, come from a Jamaican family, and am grateful for the places my journey in academia has taken me so far. I am excited for the future of the BlackInData organisation, and for the amazing things I know we will achieve as a community.
