    I am passionate about better understanding the effects of technology on society and I'm especially interested in ensuring the benefits of tech are applied equitably, that the tech workforce reflects the diversity of the population, and that the data used to develop tech tools is free of harmful biases. In May 2020, I graduated from Emory University with my Ph.D. in Genetics and Molecular Biology. In my research, I used bioinformatics tools to characterize the molecular changes in humans with age to better understand the relationship between aging and human health.

    Throughout my graduate studies, I have: advocated for graduate students as President of my graduate schools student government, volunteered in K-12 science outreach and education initiatives around Atlanta, taught undergraduates how to code as a TA of an introductory statistics course, and mentored underrepresented graduate students in STEM. After defending my Ph.D., I worked as a Science and Technology Policy Mirzayan Fellow at the National Academies where I contributed to research policies to increase the number of Women of Color working in tech.

    Now that I've finished my PhD, I'm hoping to find a career that allows me to combine my love of working with data with my love of shaping evidence-based policy. Policy has touched every aspect of my life. I grew up American because immigration policies allowed my mother to immigrate from Jamaica. I was able to attend college because of Cornell University’s policy to waive tuition and housing costs for low income students. I could pursue my graduate degree because of policies to provide funding to the National Science Foundation to support young scientists in their training. It is clear to me that even if we don’t want to participate in politics, it will impact every aspect of our lives, so I'm eager to make sure high quality data and proper data analysis is the backbone of policy.
