> I’m Black in Data because 

Pronouns: she/her

Hello! I’m a graduate of Occidental College where I received a BA in Cognitive Science and minored in Neuroscience. My main interest in mind/brain science is improving neuropsychiatric health, especially by getting to the bottom of what neuropsychiatric “disorder” actually is.

My senior thesis examined executive function deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders and explored classifying psychopathology at the cognitive level to build a bridge between symptom based diagnostic frameworks and the neurobiological research that attempts to explain those symptoms. While writing my senior thesis I realized two things: (1) lots of data and computation beyond my current ability is necessary to understand the complexity of cognition and the nuance of neuropsychiatric disorders, and (2) definitions of psychopathology are inextricable from social context.

From there I developed my broad career goals: (1) acquire the quantitative skills needed to make sense of this wildly complex organ called the brain and the minds they (allegedly) create, and (2) incorporate social considerations into science and use science to improve society.

Throughout college I planned to apply to neuroscience PhD programs but after graduation I began considering non-traditional routes toward mind/brain research. I am now exploring data science as a path toward making an impact in neuropsychiatric research and social justice.

My interests include computational psychiatry, precision medicine, mental healthcare, advocacy for marginalized groups in mental healthcare, neurodiversity, health tech, using data science for social good, and the social implications of big data and AI.

I am currently looking for volunteer and paid positions where I can contribute to research and improve my computational and data science skills!
