I’m a graduate of Occidental College where I received a BA in Cognitive Science and minored in Neuroscience. My main interest in mind/brain science is improving neuropsychiatric health, especially by getting to the bottom of what neuropsychiatric “disorder” actually is.\nMy senior thesis examined executive function deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders and explored classifying psychopathology at the cognitive level to build a bridge between symptom based diagnostic frameworks and the neurobiological research that attempts to explain those symptoms. While writing my senior thesis I realized two things: (1) lots of data and computation beyond my current ability is necessary to understand the complexity of cognition and the nuance of neuropsychiatric disorders, and (2) definitions of psychopathology are inextricable from social context.\nFrom there I developed my broad career goals: (1) acquire the quantitative skills needed to make sense of this wildly complex organ called the brain and the minds they (allegedly) create, and (2) incorporate social considerations into science and use science to improve society.\nThroughout college I planned to apply to neuroscience PhD programs but after graduation I began considering non-traditional routes toward mind/brain research. I am now exploring data science as a path toward making an impact in neuropsychiatric research and social justice.\nMy interests include computational psychiatry, precision medicine, mental healthcare, advocacy for marginalized groups in mental healthcare, neurodiversity, health tech, using data science for social good, and the social implications of big data and AI.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0b0167b355a0c7bc9a80255ee3d305ee","permalink":"https://blkindata.github.io/author/chloe-hoeber/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/chloe-hoeber/","section":"authors","summary":"I am Black In Data because I am at heart a problem solver and I believe data science is the most powerful skill set to solve the problems I\u0026rsquo;m most invested in.","tags":null,"title":"Chloe Hoeber","type":"authors"},{"authors":["crystal-grant"],"categories":null,"content":" I am #BlackInData because data is a tool we can use to generate new knowledge and information.

We are hosting the “Black In Data Visualisation Challenge” to showcase the data visualisation skills of the many talented Black people in the field of data sciences. We also host this challenge to highlight data that shows Black people in a positive light (we thought long and hard about which dataset to use - we hope you like it), and to highlight the power of collaboration (as seen in ours with the Data Visualization Society).\nSubmission Information: Please submit your data visualisation image as a pdf, with a title/description to complement. Deadlines for submission are January 4th, 2021 at 1200 BST. Submissions will be judged on their message, design, and clarity.\nEligibility criteria: All competition entrants must identify as a person of the Black diaspora. In submitting your image to us, you confirm that you have performed the data analysis to produce the image yourself. You also give permission for us to share the image with our judging panel, host your image on the Data Visualization Society online gallery (with your name accredited), and to share the image on the Black In Data twitter (with your name accredited).\nLink to data source: TBA\nLink to collecting submissions: TBA\n","date":1605772800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605772800,"objectID":"f8b27af4062c1a2e9277348a16dfd2db","permalink":"https://blkindata.github.io/talk/datavizdaycomp2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/datavizdaycomp2020/","section":"talk","summary":"Do you enjoy visualization and storytelling?
